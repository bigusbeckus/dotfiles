# dotfiles

My attempt at automating my linux setup. It has two main sections:

### Init

Folder: `init`

Automates program installation and configuration on fresh linux installs (ubuntu and fedora supported).

See: [Init readme](init/README.md)

### Config

Folder: `config`

Contains configs for my most commonly used programs.

See: [config readme](config/README.md) for more information.
