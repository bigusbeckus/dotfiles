# Todo

- [ ] Fix neovim mason "Package eslint_d not found" error
- [ ] Fix neovim config so it doesn't need me to run `PackerSync` like 5 times to work correctly
- [ ] Fix zsh `PATH` related issues
- [ ] Add nerd fonts (JetBrains Mono and/or Fira Code should be fine)
- [ ] Automate setup for packages and scripts used for the [fedora upgrade process](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/upgrading-fedora-offline/)
- [ ] Nvidia crap
  - [ ] Automate nividia kmod driver installation from the rpm non-free repository (make sure it's not installed if no nvidia card is present)
  - [ ] Auto-install [EnvyControl](https://github.com/bayasdev/envycontrol) for switiching to/from Nvidia GPUs
